											This module includes two collaborative discussion forums. The first forum was on Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct, and The second forum was on Case Study: Accuracy of information. The following are summaries of the discussions that took place in each forum.
									</span>
									<dl>
										<dt>Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</dt>
										<dd>
											<b>Topic:</b> <em>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies" target="_blank">(ACM) </a>.</em><br/><br/>
											<p>
												This discussion started in week one and continued to the end of week 3. We reviewed the application of the ACM's ethics code, highlighted impacts on legal and social issues, and compared it to the BCS Code of Conduct. Through this discussion, I gained a better understanding of issues that affect computing professionals.
											</p>
											<p>
												In my post was about <b>Abusive Workplace Behavior</b>, I highlighted that workplace abuse is a widespread issue that affects people globally. The correlation between job quality and well-being makes it a crucial topic. The job market is currently experiencing changes, which can lead to fluctuations in the job market.

											<b>Topic:</b> <em>
											Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
										</em><br/><br/>
											<p>
												I find this discussion quite intriguing, as it focuses on Abi, a statistical researcher who faced an ethical dilemma while analyzing data on the nutritional value of a cereal called Whizzz. This case highlights the importance of research integrity, ethical considerations, statistical data usage, and the responsibilities of data analysts.

									</h2>
									<p>
										This module includes two mandatory individual exercises in units 8 and 9, focusing on inference, hypothesis testing, and summary measures. We are provided with a sample data set with both example and exercise data to practise what has been taught in the module. The following are the outcomes of the exercises.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this exercise, I was able to apply the concepts of hypothesis testing and summary measures to a given data set. I was able to calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the data set. I also performed hypothesis testing to determine if the mean of the data set is significantly different from a given value. I was able to interpret the results and draw conclusions based on the analysis. I found this exercise to be quite challenging, but it helped me to understand the concepts of hypothesis testing and summary measures better.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was glad, my prior familiarity with Excel helped me navigate through these difficulties. Nevertheless, the exercises could have been better structured to facilitate a smoother learning process. Initially, figuring out the instructions for Excel and LibreOffice took much work.

										<dt>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
												This unit focuses on the types of reasoning used in the scientific method for problem-solving. The two core types are Deductive and Inductive reasoning. Understanding the purpose of research is critical, and its three primary purposes are exploring a topic, describing findings, and explaining reasons behind it. Research ethics are crucial, particularly when people are involved.
											</p>
											<p>The first collaborative discussion was about The Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct; I posted the initial post, It was a fascinating experience to do some research on a new topic and write about it.</p>
											<p>My key take home in this unit is from QuestionPro. (2021) What is research?</p>
											<blockquote>
												<b>8 tips for conducting accurate research</b>
												<ul>
													<li>Identify the main trends and issues, opportunities, and problems you observe. Write a sentence describing each one.</li>
													<li>Keep track of the frequency with which each of the main findings appears.</li>
													<li>Make a list of your findings from the most common to the least common.</li>
													<li>Evaluate a list of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats identified in a SWOT analysis.</li>
													<li>Prepare conclusions and recommendations about your study.</li>
													<li>Act on your strategies</li>
													<li>Look for gaps in the information, and consider doing additional inquiry if necessary</li>
													<li>Plan to review the results and consider efficient methods to analyze and interpret results.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p>I need to do further research by reading through the additional readings for the unit., Miller, T., Birch, M., Mauthner, M. & Jessop, J. (2012) Ethics in Qualitative Research. 2nd Ed. London: SAGE.
												Chapters 4,5,6,10 and 11.
											</p>
											<p>
												My emotional response to this unit is excitement and curiosity. I am excited to learn about a new topic and curious to know more about it.
											</p>
											<p>I could not attend the seminar for the week as conflicted with an emergency work meeting, but I watched the recording.  It was a lot to take in and a bit challenging to understand.</p>

												This unit focuses on the importance of research questions, the literature review, and the research proposal. Research questions are essential as they guide the research process. The literature review is a critical part of the research process, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature on the research topic. The research proposal is a detailed plan that outlines the research process, including the research questions, literature review, and methodology.
											</p>
											<p>The first collaborative discussion continued, and I made a few peer responses. It was insightful to read other students' initial posts and learn from the outcome of their research. <br/>
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												What stood out for me in this unit is this statement below in the Lecturecast <br/>
												“...research questions turn a general purpose or aim into specific questions to which specific, data-driven, concrete, answers can be given”
												(Cohen et al., 2018)
											</blockquote>

										It would also be good to see some areas that have not been explored yet or have not yet been researched to a sufficient extent. You mentioned them but did not expand on this specific area.

										The reference list demonstrates evidence of reading in the discipline but more could have been offered. You have structured the material in a way that allows for a logical sequence of ideas.



										Harvard System has been overall correctly used.

										Your Turnitin score of 38% and an analysis of the turnitin report suggest an original assignment.  I think some more emphasis on the conclusions based on your previous analysis will make it even better.



										Please note the points mentioned above for a top-notch literature review for your project.

									<blockquote>
										Thank you for the submission of your research proposal.

										The assignment required a PPT presentation in a video format of your choice, covering the main points of a proposal, and namely, RQs, methodology, and some pointers to the theoretical framework underpinning your research.

										You had the opportunity to submit a draft for formative feedback, and I do hope you made good use of the possibility.

										This was a good presentation. Below you will find a breakdown of the grade:

										Knowledge and Understanding 

										You demonstrated a quite good understanding of the chosen topic.
										All the key sections of the presentation are present but not all are equally developed.

										The background could have been expanded, and the methodology could use more detail.

										There is some evidence of critical analysis in all the key sections of the presentation.

										Presentation and Communication Skills 

										The research question was clearly along with the aims and objectives.

										Criticality 

										Please above re: methodology, especially in terms of justification. To engage the audience, the presentation needs some improvement -- adding, for instance, more explanatory points to your slides.

										The references are fine but could have supported more the claims in the presentation.

										I think you're now ready for the actual final project and could use this as a starting point.
